===========

Open source repository for anyone wishing to make changes to the official Cure Please source code.

Original Repo: https://github.com/atom0s/Cure-Please

Thanks to https://github.com/Sunderous/Cure-Please for a large refactor!

This version has been migrated to .NET 5 and is now using a single file publishing mechanism. It still uses EliteMMO, but files are embedded for simplicity. If prompted to "install a newer version of .NET Core" when running the application, click "Yes" and choose "Download x86" in the "Run desktop apps" section.
